# Maya Projects - Semestral Work

Welcome to my repository showcasing two semestral projects created during my 3D modelling class. Both projects were made in **Autodesk Maya**, using 3D modeling, rigging, and animation.

## **Semestral Project 1: 3D Model of an Old Oil Lantern with a simple swinging animation**
For my first semestral project, I created a realistic 3D model of an **old oil lantern**. The goal of this project was to practice modeling, animation and texturing.  
Key features of this project:
- **Software Used:** Autodesk Maya  
- Modeled mainly by revolving curves
- Swinging animation was done by hand
- Experimented with **realistic materials** and **procedural edge wear** techniques

## **Semestral Project 2: Recreation of South Parkâ€™s "Good Times with Weapons" Scene**
My second project involved recreating a segment from my favorite South Park episode, **"Good Times with Weapons"**. This project required to create custom rigs for each character and model simple 2D parts of the body such as a set of eyes, mouths, hands etc. I also used Inverse kinematics to control the hands and legs. There are sliders which can choose what type of (eyes, mouth, etc.) the character has for the current frame. It is not perfect, but for this simple scene it worked nicely. Also I believe that South Park animators have even more sophisticated rigs with much bigger set of sprites to choose from and more profiles than just 4 (This can be seen later in the episode for the anime characters being in 8-point turnaround)  
Key features of this project:
- **Software Used:** Autodesk Maya  
- Created custom **rigs for the characters**  
- Recreated the animation **frame by frame**  
- Successfully emulated the unique style of South Park
- Procedural materials with paper like look
